## Project
For my final culminating project, I was tasked to design, CAD, and 3D Print a robot arm. The design was based off of a older design, known to the Computer Engineering classes as 'Toast'.

Toast was remodeled in Solidworks. Toast uses 8 Different pieces (not including motor mounts, screws, etc.) to become, well Toast! I modeled each piece individually, and then placed them into an ['assembly'](https://github.com/ChristianFemia/TEJ3M1-Robot-Arm/blob/main/CAD%20Files/Renders/Main%20Assembly.PNG), where I would be able to mate each part, and look for any issues that may be may be present with my design.
